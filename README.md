# De-hydration
This repository contains a numerical algorithm to simulate the propagation of (de)hydration fronts in one dimension.
The algorithm is written in Matlab.
This is the basic version of an algorithm that has been used to generate numerical results that are displayed and discussed in a scientific manuscript titled "(De)hydration Front Propagation into Zero-Permeabilty Rock", submitted to the journal Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems.
